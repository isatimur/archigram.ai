Excited to share what I've been building: ArchiGram.ai

After years of manually creating architecture diagrams, I built an AI-powered tool that generates them from natural language.

Just type: "Create a microservices architecture with API gateway, three services, Redis cache, and PostgreSQL"

Get a production-ready Mermaid diagram in 2 seconds.

Key features:
- AI-powered generation (Gemini 3 Flash)
- Vision AI to scan whiteboard sketches
- Architectural security audits
- 100% open-source

If you're a software architect, DevOps engineer, or engineering leader, I'd love your feedback.
