## 1. PRODUCT HUNT LISTING

### Tagline (60 chars max)
```
Describe your architecture. AI draws it instantly.
```

### One-liner (80 chars)
```
Open-source AI diagramming tool that turns text into system design diagrams
```

### Description (260 chars)
```
ArchiGram.ai is an AI-powered architecture diagramming tool. Describe your system in plain English, and watch Gemini AI generate Mermaid diagrams instantly. Open-source, free, and built for developers who think in systems.
```

### Full Description
```
ArchiGram.ai transforms how software architects create diagrams.

**The Problem:**
Traditional diagramming tools require hours of dragging boxes and connecting arrows. By the time you're done, your architecture has already changed.

**The Solution:**
Just describe what you want:
> "Create a microservices architecture with API gateway, three services, Redis cache, and PostgreSQL database"

AI generates production-ready Mermaid.js code in seconds.

**Key Features:**
- AI-powered diagram generation (Gemini 3 Flash)
- Vision AI: Scan whiteboard sketches into code
- Architectural audit: AI analyzes security & scalability risks
- Multiple formats: Mermaid, PlantUML, BPMN
- Community gallery to share and fork diagrams
- 100% open-source (MIT License)

**Built for:**
- Software architects designing systems
- DevOps engineers documenting infrastructure
- Engineering managers explaining architectures
- Students learning system design

**Tech Stack:**
React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Google Gemini AI, Mermaid.js, Supabase

## 2. FIRST COMMENT (Maker's Comment)

```
Hey Product Hunt!

I'm Timur, the maker of ArchiGram.ai.

**Why I built this:**
As a software architect, I spent countless hours in Lucidchart and Draw.io, manually placing boxes and drawing arrows. Every architecture review meant redrawing diagrams from scratch.

Then I discovered Mermaid.js - diagrams as code. But writing Mermaid syntax from memory is tedious.

So I combined my two passions:
1. AI that understands system design
2. Code-first diagramming

**The result:** Describe your architecture in plain English, get production-ready diagrams instantly.

**What makes ArchiGram different:**
- **AI-native**: Built around Gemini 3 Flash, not bolted on
- **Open-source**: Self-host or use our free hosted version
- **Vision AI**: Scan physical whiteboards into code
- **Audit feature**: AI analyzes your architecture for security risks

**What I'd love feedback on:**
1. What diagram types would you add?
2. Would you pay for team collaboration features?
3. Any integrations you'd want? (VS Code, Notion, Slack?)

I'll be here all day answering questions!

## 4. SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS

### Twitter/X Launch Thread
```
[1/7] I just launched ArchiGram.ai on Product Hunt!

Describe your architecture in plain English.
AI generates the diagram instantly.

100% open-source.

Let me show you what it can do...

[Link to Product Hunt]
```

```
[2/7] The Problem:

Traditional diagramming tools:
- Drag boxes for hours
- Manually connect arrows
- Redo everything when architecture changes

There had to be a better way.
```

```
[3/7] The Solution:

Just type:
"API gateway → 3 microservices → Redis cache → Postgres"

Get a production-ready Mermaid diagram in 2 seconds.

[GIF demo]
```

```
[4/7] But wait, there's more:

Vision AI: Scan your whiteboard sketch

AI converts it to clean, editable code.

No more "let me redraw that whiteboard diagram"

[Screenshot]
```

```
[5/7] Architectural Audit:

AI analyzes your diagram for:
- Single points of failure
- Security vulnerabilities
- Scalability bottlenecks

Like a code review, but for architecture.

[Screenshot]
```

```
[6/7] Tech stack for the curious:

- React 19 + TypeScript
- Google Gemini 3 Flash
- Mermaid.js
- Supabase
- Vite
- Deployed on Vercel

All open-source: github.com/isatimur/archigram.ai
```

```
[7/7] If you find this useful:

- Upvote on Product Hunt [link]
- Star on GitHub [link]
- Share with your architect friends

I'll be answering questions all day!

What features would you add?
```

### LinkedIn Post
```
I'm excited to announce the launch of ArchiGram.ai on Product Hunt today!

After years of manually drawing architecture diagrams, I built a tool that lets you describe systems in plain English and generates diagrams instantly using AI.

Key features:
- AI-powered diagram generation
- Vision AI to scan whiteboard sketches
- Architectural security audits
- 100% open-source

If you're a software architect, DevOps engineer, or engineering leader, I'd love your feedback.

## 6. HUNTER OUTREACH TEMPLATE

```
Subject: Would you hunt ArchiGram.ai? (AI architecture diagramming)

Hi [Name],

I've been following your Product Hunt activity and loved your hunt of [Previous Hunt].

I built ArchiGram.ai - an open-source AI tool that generates architecture diagrams from natural language descriptions. It's like GitHub Copilot, but for system design diagrams.

Key differentiators:
- First open-source AI diagramming tool
- Vision AI to scan whiteboard sketches
- Architectural security audits

Would you be interested in hunting it? I can send over all the assets and handle all the comments/support.

Happy to send a demo or answer any questions!

Best,
Timur
```
